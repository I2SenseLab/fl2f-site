review: The opportunity to better understand entrepreneurship and become familiar with key tools was extremely valuable. Orly presented the processes involved in entrepreneurship and the tools that she has found useful in a logical and concise way. The framework that she discussed changed my thinking about how to approach new ventures, especially customer development strategies and the idea of a minimum viable product. The framework is also very useful for developing grant proposals and negotiating new research and development partnerships with industry. I also appreciated the fact that the workshop acknowledged our multiple roles and allowed us to identify the strengths that are associated with these experiences
