review: I wholeheartedly recommend the FL2F workshop. It was a one-of-a-kind experience from which I left feeling empowered. The workshop consists of a mix of group sessions led by Orly, guest speakers, and one-on-one sessions, with the goal of helping each researcher bring their own idea to market.
