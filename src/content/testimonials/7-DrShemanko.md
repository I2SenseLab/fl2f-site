review: “For many of us I think, in research, it is a linear path for discovery, for the most part. It involves funding, and discovery, and, luckily for me, it involved the From Lab 2 Fulfillment course. It helped me think about my research in a much different way, and learning the skills that I had has helped not only in my research, but in other aspects.I think one of the most important things that I've taken home from the workshop is that what you do with that company is also up to you. You follow your own ethics and values in that company and you build your company based on that, and I just think that is a wonderful way to look at this part of our lives.”
