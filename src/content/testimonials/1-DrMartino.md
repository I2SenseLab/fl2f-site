review: "For me, the most important thing is to reflect on my role. I've been actively writing patents and getting my creativ juices flowing. I had a patent, of course, to start with, but now we wrote another four! That to me has been the most rewarding part of it. The most important thing for me was to understand what I wanted to do."
