review: The workshop has been professionally delivered while exposing the participants to a variety of interesting tools, which I believe are also useful in daily research. Fulfillment is not just about opening a new start-up, and in that sense, the workshop is an important channel for transferring knowledge regarding handling different functions outside academia.
