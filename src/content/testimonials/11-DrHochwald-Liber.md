review: I came to the FL2F workshop expecting to get some information about entrepreneurship and maybe some tips on where to get started, and what I got was so much more! I acquired skills, built confidence, and learned so much. The workshop not only helped me get started, but it also provided me with tangible tools and a roadmap that I know how to use to get my venture started. It is the most valuable professional development experience I have had in a long time.
