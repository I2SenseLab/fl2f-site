review: FL2F has been of extreme value to me and I would wholeheartedly like to recommend it for all women clinicians involved in research! As a translational scientist, we never learnt anywhere these important issues that FL2F brought to our awareness, based on Orly's personal experience. The workshop was an amazing framework that set us for growth. I especially liked the creative thinking and strengthening your IP section, and I use some of the tools and materials that I was exposed to during the workshop on a regular basis since.
