review: What you need sometimes is someone who can take your hand and coach you and really guide you along that journey, and for me that's part of what the From Lab to Fulfillment program was. And it was a tool to help design, help direct, and coach and move us along in this journey, so that we could find the destinations we were looking at, and then, once we found one destination, we had the skills to be able to find others, to be able to go on other journeys and other places.
