review: I would like to whole heartfully recommend the FL2F workshop that Dr. Yadid-Pecht offers. It has been my pleasure to observe the women from Engineering and Science faculties connect and form a support group for entrepreneurship with Orly's guidance. I also observed the growth and the change of thinking the women demonstrated throughout and after the workshop. A few of them said that it changed their way of thinking about their research and their projects, and if this way of thinking spreads out, I believe our university will gain a lot from this change in perspective and focus on real market needs.
