review: To support women faculty members with an interest to learn more about the potential commercialization of their ideas and inventions, Queen’s University introduced an initial cohort of 8 women faculty members to the From Lab 2 Fulfillment (FL2F) Workshop in 2022. Hosted by Dr. Orly Yadid-Petch and her team, FL2F provided an opportunity for researchers from different Faculties across the University to connect in a supportive space for women to learn and explore pivoting their research into commercial interests. We are pleased to provide support to the FL2F program in Eastern Ontario with recently announced funding from the WeBC’s Capital, Community, Capacity (C3) Project, under the Women Entrepreneurship Strategy (WES) Ecosystem Fund
