review: The Women Entrepreneurs-in-STEM program (WESTEM), through Economic Development Lethbridge (EDL), is pleased to recommend the From Lab to Fulfillment (FL2F) workshop series that you offer. This workshop provides a valuable opportunity for women from academic, research and STEM backgrounds to network, collaborate and explore the possibilities of entrepreneurship and patent creation. Women face various obstacles in both STEM fields and entrepreneurship across Canada, and the WESTEM program aims to limit the barriers that women face in these areas. For this reason, we were very pleased to have Dr. Yadid-Pecht offer her workshop to our clients, and look forward to having her offer it again. FL2F has proven to be an accessible and valuable workshop for women as they explore and transition from academia, research, or STEM careers to entrepreneurship.
