title: What is the time commitment for the program?
---

The program consists of group meetings (5 meetings of ~1.5 hours each and the sixth which is longer), online video materials (5 sessions of ~1 hour each), and coaching (2 sessions of 25 minutes for each participant). In addition to the time you spend attending the group meetings and watching the related online videos, you will need to spend about 1-2 hours on homework per session. The group sessions are usually anytime from 9:00 a.m. MST to 12:00 p.m. MST.
