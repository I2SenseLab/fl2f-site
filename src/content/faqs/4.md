You will be required fill out or sign:

1. Pre- and post-workshop surveys

2. A confidentality and consent form.

The pre- and post-workshop survey is an “entrepreneurship barometer”, or snapshot. We would like to check where you are at in terms of entrepreneurship competencies, before and after the workshop.

The confidentiality agreement focuses on protecting each of your unique ideas that you will work on in the workshop and includes a data use consent, media use consent, and an acknowledgment of our cancellation procedures.
